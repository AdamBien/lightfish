Installation:
Open and "Run" the lightfish project with NetBeans - it will create the datasource for you and deploy the application and open the browser.
Or:
1. mvn -Pjavafx clean install multi-light project
2. Drop the lightfish/target/lightfish.war into /glassfish3.1.X/glassfish/domains/domain1/autodeploy
3. Point your browser to: http://localhost:8080/lightfish

LightFish requires JDK 1.7. It was compiled with Java 7 features.

LightFish should install the necessary connection pool and datasources on-the-fly. There is no setup needed. Tested with GlassFish 3.1.2.
